## what is the growth wallet?

the growth wallet is a smart contract that holds:
- **usdc** from trading tax revenue (1.6% of every trade)
- **tokens** from your 40% allocation

these funds can only be spent on suppliers in the noice marketplace.

## balances

### usdc balance
this accumulates automatically from trading. check your company dashboard to see current balance.

### token balance
400 million tokens (40% of supply) are locked here. you can use these to pay suppliers.

## spending

### usdc payments
1. request quote from supplier
2. approve and fund from usdc balance
3. funds held in escrow
4. released on delivery approval

### token payments
1. request quote (mention you want to pay in tokens)
2. supplier quotes a token price (often discounted)
3. tokens transferred from growth wallet to escrow
4. released on delivery approval

## restrictions

<Warning>
growth wallet funds can only be spent on noice marketplace suppliers. you cannot withdraw to personal wallet.
</Warning>

this ensures the ecosystem stays healthy - tokens flow from founders to growth suppliers who provide real value.

## tracking spend

your dashboard shows:
- total spent
- spend by category
