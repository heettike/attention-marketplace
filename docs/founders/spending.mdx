## views per dollar

the key metric is **views per $** (vpd). this tells you how much reach you get for each dollar spent.

### benchmarks

| category | typical vpd | notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| kols | 30-50 | high reach, variable engagement |
| trenching | 10-20 | targeted but smaller |
| video | 100-200 | high vpd if content goes viral |
| podcasts | 40-60 | engaged audience |
| newsletters | 20-40 | high intent audience |
