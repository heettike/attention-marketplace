## fixed tokenomics

every token launched on noice has the same structure. this keeps things simple and fair.

### supply

```
total supply: 1,000,000,000 tokens
```

### allocation

| allocation | percentage | purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| retail | 50% | available for trading |
| growth wallet | 40% | locked for marketplace spending |
| team | 10% | vested over time |

### trading tax

every trade has a 2% fee:

| recipient | percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| founder (you) | 1.6% |
| noice | 0.4% |

## growth wallet

the 40% growth wallet allocation can only be spent on suppliers in the noice marketplace. this ensures the tokens flow back into growth activities.

### how it works

1. tokens are held in a smart contract
2. you request a quote from a supplier
3. supplier accepts and sets a price
4. tokens are released to supplier upon delivery approval

### spending tokens vs usdc

you can pay suppliers in:
- **usdc** from trading tax revenue
- **tokens** from your growth wallet allocation

most suppliers accept both. token payments are typically discounted.

## pairing

all tokens are paired to usdc on base. this provides:
- stable pricing
- easy on/off ramps
- liquid markets

## contract addresses

<Note>
contracts are open source and verified on basescan.
