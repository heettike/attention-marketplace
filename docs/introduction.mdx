## what is noice?

noice is an attention marketplace for startups. launch a token, earn from every trade, and spend those earnings on vetted growth talent.

### the flywheel

1. **launch your token** - deploy in minutes on base. 50% to traders, 40% to your growth wallet, 10% to team
2. **earn from speculation** - 2% fee on every trade. 1.6% goes to your marketplace wallet
3. **hire growth talent** - spend earnings on kols, market makers, video producers, and more

### why it works

people talk about what they own. when traders buy your token, they become advocates. the trading tax funds your growth budget, creating a self-sustaining attention flywheel.

## attention coins

<Warning>
attention coins are not securities. they do not represent ownership, equity, or any claim to profits or assets. they are purely a mechanism for communities to signal attention and support for projects.
