## payment types

### usdc payments
- instant settlement
- no price risk
- withdraw anytime

### token payments
- often larger amounts
- price risk (token may go up or down)
- can hold for upside or sell immediately

## fees

noice takes **10%** of each transaction.

| payment | your cut | noice fee |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| $10,000 | $9,000 | $1,000 |

## disputes

if a founder doesn't approve delivery:
1. you can raise a dispute
2. noice team reviews deliverables vs scope
3. mediation if needed
4. funds released or returned based on outcome

## tax considerations

<Warning>
you are responsible for your own taxes. noice provides transaction records but does not withhold or report taxes.
</Warning>

keep records of:
- all payments received
- usdc vs token payments
- token sale prices if you sell
